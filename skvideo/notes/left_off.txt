Make sure that unary costs are being applied correctly.

Could it be that our euclidean distance calculator doesn't work as expected?
Check that method with the values we're using and make sure it's not off base.
Perhaps the fact that we're using integer values in the Euclidean distance!
-> Is that even the right calculator? Just write our own for ints right there
